CodeBook.md: Describes the data, the variables and the process of transformation from the original data set to the tidy data.

run_analysis.R: Contains the code used to download the data and prepare it to be used. It includes the 5 required steps presented in the project instructions. Those steps are:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

DATA.txt: Is the second, independent tidy data set described in step 5.
